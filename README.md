# TS Polymorphism

A demonstration of polymorphism using Typescript in a React app.

## About

Note that we're not using inheritance with React components themselves, this is in fact [discouraged](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html). Rather, we create Typescript classes to encapsulate behaviour that may not belong in React components.

In this case, polymorphism is used to simplify the logic for creating and switching between brushes in a painting app.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

2. Run the app in the development mode then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
